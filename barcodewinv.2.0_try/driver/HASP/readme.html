<h1>Sentinel<sup>&reg;</sup>
LDK and Sentinel HASP<sup>&reg;</sup>
Run-time Environment Command-line Installer: Readme</h1>
<h2>Installer Version 6.64</h2>
<h2>Package Version 6.64</h2>
<h3>August 2014</h3>
<hr align="left">
<p>This document provides
information regarding the Run-time
Environment Command-line Installer for Sentinel HASP and Sentinel LDK,
including enhancements and limitations. Using this installer, you can
use HASP4, Hardlock, Sentinel HL, Sentinel HASP, and Sentinel LDK
under any of the supported operating systems. ("Sentinel LDK" is the
next generation of Sentinel HASP.)</p>
<h2>Operating Systems Supported</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Windows XP SP3 (x86)</li>
  <li> Windows XP SP2 (x64)</li>
  <li> Windows Vista SP2</li>
  <li> Windows 7 SP1</li>
  <li> Windows 8.1</li>
  <li> Windows Server 2003 SP2</li>
  <li> Windows 2008 SP2</li>
  <li> Windows 2008 R2 SP1</li>
  <li> Windows Server 2012 R2</li>
  <li> Windows 7 SP1 Embedded
    standard (x86)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The latest service packs and
security updates must be installed.</p>
<p> The installer detects the version of the operating system at run-time,
before
installing the relevant drivers. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows XP Embedded is not supported with this installer. To install the Run-time Environment under Windows XP Embedded, use <strong>akshasp.sld</strong>. This file can be found under <strong>\Runtime Environment\win_xp_embedded\</strong> in your installation of Sentinel LDK or Sentinel HASP.</p>
<h2>Changes in Terminology</h2>
<p>With the introduction of
Sentinel LDK, changes to terminology were incorporated in Sentinel
Admin Control Center user interface and help files as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Sentinel HASP product is
now referred to as Sentinel LDK.</li>
  <li>SL keys that were created
with Sentinel HASP Business Studio now
appear in the user interface as "SL-Legacy" keys.</li>
  <li>References to Sentinel EMS
in the help files are also valid for
Sentinel HASP Business Studio. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Type <b><code>haspdinst.exe
-?</code></b>
for command-line help.</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>To use Sentinel EMS to
produce Run-time Environment installers in the Sentinel LDK v.6.0 or
later environment, overwrite the <code>haspdinst.exe</code>
file in <br>
    <b>%SystemDrive%\Program Files
(x86)\SafeNet Sentinel\Sentinel EMS\EMSServer\webapps\ems\haspTools\</b>
with the file in this package. (For Win32 systems, go to <b>\Program
Files\...</b>)</li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>A log file of the
installation process is written to <b>aksdrvsetup.log</b>
in the Windows directory.</li>
</ul>
<b>Note</b>
<ul>
  <li>By default, Windows Vista
(and later) operating systems display a <b>User
Account Control</b> message during
driver installation. Users must click <b>Continue</b>
to continue the installation. Alternatively, users can change the
default setting from the Control Panel of their operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrade Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When upgrading the Run-time
Environment, ensure that it is not currently being accessed (for
example: by closing all applications). Although the installation
program can
terminate applications that are accessing the Run-time, it cannot
terminate running services. </li>
  <br>
  <br>
  <li>If you are running HASP
License Manager (HASP4 and HASP HL legacy
License Manager) as a service, you must stop the License Manager before
proceeding with the installation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessing Admin Control Center
in Internet Explorer Metro Mode</h2>
<p>Under Windows 8, Internet
Explorer 10 can be operated in "desktop" style or "Metro" style. When
users attempt to access Admin Control Center for the local License
Manager in the Metro style browser, they get the message "This page
can't be displayed". (This problem does not occur when a user attempt
to access Admin Control Center for a remote License Manager.)</p>
<p>To access Admin Control Center
for the local License Manager under Windows 8 with Internet Explorer
10, the user must do either of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operate Internet Explorer in
desktop style:
    <ol>
      <br>
      <li>After you receive the
message "This page can't be displayed" in Metro style, click the wrench
icon at the bottom right of the browser window.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Click <b>View
on the desktop</b>. Admin Control
Center is displayed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Enable Internet Explorer to
access Admin Control Center in Metro style:
    <ol>
      <br>
      <li>After you receive the
message "This page can't be displayed" in Metro style, click the wrench
icon at the bottom right of the browser window.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Click <b>View
on the desktop</b>. Admin Control
Center is displayed.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Click the cogwheel
("Tools") icon at the top right of the browser window. From the menu,
select <b>Internet options
&gt; Security</b>. Select the <b>Trusted
sites</b> zone. Click the <b>Sites</b>
button.</li>
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>"http://localhost" is
already filled in. Click <b>Add</b>.
Close the screen.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Compatibility Issues</h2>
<h3>Control Guard Agent</h3>
<p> When Control Guard Agent
  version 4.0.0.27 is present on a computer, installation of the Run-time
  Environment will cause the operating system to crash. If this occurs,
  update to a later version of Control Guard Agent. </p>
<h3>Trend Micro OfficeScan</h3>
<p>When Trend Micro OfficeScan  is present on a computer, installation of the Run-time Environment may stall.</p>
<p>Trend Micro has released the following hotfix to resolve this issue: Trend Micro OfficeScan 10.6 Service  Pack 3 Patch 1.1Â  Hot Fix - Server Build  5592 and Client Module Build 5445.</p>
<p> Contact  the Trend Micro support team to obtain this hotfix. See the readme file included in the hotfix for more details.</p>
